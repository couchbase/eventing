# JS Evaluator REST API
This is the JS evaluator API. These REST APIs are available at the Admin Port of the MDS
service that embeds the function capabilities.

*For N1QL Functions, these REST APIs would be available on port 8093 of any N1QL node*.

Note that for all calls:
  1. If `name` attribute appears in the body, it must match the name specified in the URL
  2. If `name` is not specified in the body, it defaults to the name specified on the URL
  3. The HTTP Content-Type must be `application/json` for all below REST API calls

*6.5.0 beta does not have lifecycle operations of Functions (publish/unpublish)*

## Creating/Updating a function
> POST /functions/v1/libraries/`<library_name>`/functions/`<function_name>`

Note that if the function already exists in the library, it is overwritten. Otherwise, the
function is added to the library. If a library does not exist, one will be created.

Only JS functions whose name matches the name of the Couchbase function object are exported.

Below example creates a function by name `sub` in library `math`. The function `sub` is
publicly exported, while the function `helper` is not.

```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries/math/functions/sub \
  -u Administrator:password \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "sub",
    "code": "function sub(a,b) { return helper(a,b); }\n function helper(a,b) { return a - b; }"
}'
```

## Creating/Updating a library
> POST /functions/v1/libraries/`<library_name>`

Note that if the library exists, the function specified will be added to the existing library.
If a specified function already exists in the old library, it will be overwritten.

Below example creates a library by name `math`.

```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries/math \
  -u Administrator:password \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "math",
    "functions": [
        {"name": "add","code": "function add(a, b) { let data = a + b; return data; } "},
        {"name": "sub","code": "function sub(a, b) { let data = a - b; return data; } "},
        {"name": "mul","code": "function mul(a, b) { let data = a * b; return data; } "}
    ]
}'
```

## Creating/Updating a collection of libraries
> POST /functions/v1/libraries

Note that if any specified library exists, the functions specified in the body for that library
will be appended to the existing library. If the function in the library exists in the library
on the server, the function will be overwritten.

Below example adds/updates two libraries, `math` and `science`.

```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries \
  -u Administrator:password \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '[
  {
    "name": "math",
    "functions":
    [
      {
        "name": "adder",
        "code": "function adder(a, b) { return a + b; } function helper() { return; }"
      },
      {
        "name": "multiplier",
        "code": "function multiplier(a, b) { return a * b; } function helper() { return; }"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "science",
    "functions":
    [
      {
        "name": "f2c",
        "code": "function f2c(f) { return (5/9)*(f-32); }"
      }
    ]
  }
]'
```

## Reading a function
> GET /functions/v1/libraries/`<library_name>`/functions/`<function_name>`

Returns specified function the specified library.

Below example gets function `sub` from library `math`.

```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries/math/functions/sub \
  -u Administrator:password \
```

## Reading a library
> GET /functions/v1/libraries/`<library_name>`

Returns a library with all its functions.

Below example gets all functions in library `math`.

```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries/math \
  -u Administrator:password \
```

## Reading all libraries
> GET /functions/v1/libraries

Returns all libraries and functions.

Below example fetches all defined libraries.

```
curl -X GET \
  http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries \
  -u Administrator:password \
```

## Delete a function in a library
> DELETE /functions/v1/libraries/`<library_name>`/functions/`<function_name>`

Deletes the specified function in a library.

Below example deletes function `sub` in the `math` library.

```
curl -X DELETE \
  http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries/math/functions/sub \
  -u Administrator:password \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
```

## Delete an entire library
> DELETE /functions/v1/libraries/`<library_name>`

Delete the specified library entirely.

Below example deletes `math` library entirely.

```
curl -X DELETE \
  http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries/math \
  -u Administrator:password \
```

## Delete all libraries
> DELETE /functions/v1/libraries

Deletes all libraries entirely.

Below example deletes all libraries defined in the system.

```
curl -X DELETE \
  http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries \
  -u Administrator:password \
```

## Replacing a function
> PUT /functions/v1/libraries/`<library_name>`/functions/`<function_name>`

This has same effect as doing a POST to the specified URI and is included for completeness.

## Replacing a library
> PUT /functions/v1/libraries/`<library_name>`

This has exactly the same effect as DELETE of the above URI followed by a POST of the specified body.

That is, if the library exists, it is deleted entirely and replaced with the contents of
the library specified in the body of this call, resulting in the library having only functions
specified by this call exclusively.

Below replaces `math` library with new copy, dropping any old `math` library.

```
curl -X PUT \
  http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries/math \
  -u Administrator:password \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "name": "math",
    "functions": [
        {"name": "add","code": "function add(a, b) { let data = a + b; return data; } "},
        {"name": "sub","code": "function sub(a, b) { let data = a - b; return data; } "},
        {"name": "mul","code": "function mul(a, b) { let data = a * b; return data; } "}
    ]
}'
```

## Replacing all libraries
> PUT /functions/v1/libraries

This has exactly the same effect as DELETE of the above URI followed by a POST of the specified body.

That is, all existing libraries in the system are deleted, and the libraries specified in the
body of this call are created, resulting in the system having exclusively the libraries
specified by this call.

Below removes all libraries in the system and creates a new `math` library.

```
curl -X PUT \
  http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries \
  -u Administrator:password \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '[
    {
        "name": "math",
        "functions": [
            {"name": "add","code": "function add(a, b) { let data = a + b; return data; } "},
            {"name": "sub","code": "function sub(a, b) { let data = a - b; return data; } "},
            {"name": "mul","code": "function mul(a, b) { let data = a * b; return data; } "}
        ]
    }
]'
```
