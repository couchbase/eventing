# Eventing Settings

#### Disclaimer: ####

* Most of the settings below are internal settings. They should not be changed
  from default values without consulting with developers or Couchbase Tech Support.
* We've tried limited combinations for different setting parameters. It's best
  to stick with default configuration unless instructed otherwise. In worst case, some
  untested non-default configuration could leave the cluster unusable.
